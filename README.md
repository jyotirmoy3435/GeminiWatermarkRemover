# Gemini Watermark Remover

A lightweight, high-performance Chrome Extension that automatically removes the visual watermark from images generated by Google Gemini.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Automatic Detection:** automatically finds Gemini-generated images on the page.
*   **Seamless Removal:** Removes the watermark overlay using reverse alpha blending.
*   **Download Interception:** Intercepts the "Download" button to ensure you save the clean, non-watermarked version.
*   **Privacy Focused:** All processing happens locally in your browser. No images are sent to external servers.

## 🛠️ Installation

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you need to install it manually using "Developer Mode".

1.  **Download or Clone** this repository to a folder on your computer.
2.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to:
    `chrome://extensions`
3.  In the top right corner, toggle **Developer mode** to **ON**.
4.  Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears in the top left.
5.  Select the **folder** containing `manifest.json` (e.g., `GeminiWatermarkRemover`).
6.  The extension is now installed! You should see the icon in your toolbar.

## 📖 How it Works

1.  **Injection:** The extension injects a module into the page context to access the HTML5 Canvas API.
2.  **Detection:** It monitors the DOM for images hosted on `googleusercontent.com` that match Gemini's generation signature.
3.  **Fetching:** It fetches the high-resolution version of the image via a background script to bypass CORS restrictions.
4.  **Processing:**
    *   It loads a raw binary alpha mask.
    *   It applies a reverse blending formula: `Original = (Watermarked - α × Logo) / (1 - α)`.
5.  **Replacement:** The watermarked image on the screen is swapped with the processed clean blob.
